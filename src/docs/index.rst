Introduction
============

The **c-rbtree** project provides a Red-Black-Tree API, that is fully
implemented in ISO-C11 and has no external dependencies. Furthermore, tree
traversal, memory allocations, and key comparisons are completely controlled by
the API user. The implementation only provides the RB-Tree specific rebalancing
and coloring.
